# Sony_Picture_Entertainment_Project

### Business Goal: 
#### Sony works with user level data from multiple lines of business including movie purchase, digital locker, viewership, and click data. 
The marketing team has come to you and asked you to help them understand our customers that purchase movies (physical or electronic copies) and improve their marketing campaigns.  We recognize that customers vary in their tastes, preferences and behavior.  We believe there are several approaches that can be used to establish a deeper understanding of these individuals.  Some examples are detailed in Step 2 below.  With a better understanding, our marketing team can make more meaningful decisions and campaign offers that are relevant and increase our ability to convert them to purchasing or viewing our movies and TV series.
