# Sony_Picture_Entertainment_Project

### Business Goal: 
- Sony works with user level data from multiple lines of business including movie purchase, digital locker, viewership, and click data. We create this marketing analysis to help marketing team understand customers that purchase movies (physical or electronic copies) and improve the marketing campaigns.  We recognize that customers vary in their tastes, preferences and behavior. With the analysis, marketing team can make more meaningful decisions and campaign offers that are relevant and increase the ability to convert customers to highly active users, as the result, more purchases and views on movies and TV series.
